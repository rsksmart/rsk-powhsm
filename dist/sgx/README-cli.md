# powHSM for SGX Setup and onboarding

## Prerequisites

The computer on which the powHSM setup and onboarding is to be executed needs the following installed:

- Docker

## Reminders

- Before running the setup script, make sure that the current user has `sudo` privileges
- Make sure to have the following information at hand:
	- The absolute path where the powHSM is to be installed
	- The pin that will be used to connect to the powHSM

All the items listed above will be required during the setup process, and failing to provide them will result in
the setup script aborting and the entire process will have to be restarted.

## Installation

Unless otherwise specified, all commands are to be executed in the machine in which the powHSM is to be installed.

To setup a brand new powHSM, assuming the powHSM distribution is located in `/path/to/dist` directory, issue:

```
/path/to/dist> sudo ./setup-new-powhsm
```

and follow the instructions provided by the script. The following subsections provide a detailed description of
each step. Experienced users can skip to the [What's next](#whats-next) section.

### Selecting the install directory

The first step is to provide the absolute path to the installation directory:
```
Welcome to the SGX powHSM Setup for RSK 
Enter the absolute path to the installation directory (empty directory name to abort)
> 
```
Make sure to provide the absolute path to an **unexisting** directory. The script will create the specified directory
and will refuse to proceed in case it already exists.

For this example, we will use `/opt/powhsm` as the installation directory, but any valid path can be used. The script
will then require that the path to the installation directory is confirmed:
```
Welcome to the SGX powHSM Setup for RSK 
Enter the absolute path to the installation directory (empty directory name to abort)
> /opt/powhsm
powHSM will be installed to /opt/powhsm
Proceed? [Y/N]
> Y

Installing the powHSM...

Starting the powHSM...
```
Reply with `Y` if the directory is correct and you wish to proceed with the installation. In case the path is incorrect
or you wish to abort the installation, feel free to reply with `N` and start over.

### Onboarding the powHSM

The script will then prompt for a second confirmation before proceeding with the onboarding process:
```
Onboarding the powHSM... 
#######################################
### -> Onboarding and attestation setup
#######################################
Connecting to HSM... OK

Sending echo... Echo OK
Is device onboarded? ... Onboarded: No
************************************************
The following operation will onboard the device.
Do you want to proceed? Yes/No
************************************************
>
```
Confirm the onboarding process by replying with `Yes`. The script will then proceed with the onboarding process. At any
time, you can abort the onboarding process by replying with `No`.

The next thing the script will prompt for is the pin for the powHSM. The pin must be composed exactly by 8 alphanumeric
characters, at least one of which must be an alphabetic character. After entering the pin and pressing `Enter`, the
script will proceed with the onboarding process.
```
Please select a pin for the device. The pin must be 8 characters long and contain at least one alphabetic character.
>
Generating a random seed... Seed generated
Onboarding... Onboarded
Disconnecting from HSM... OK
***************
Onboarding done
***************
Onboarding complete.
```

Remember to keep the pin safe, as it will be required in the following steps and by design it will not be recorded at
any of the steps of the setup process.

### Attestation gathering

After completing the onboarding process, the script will proceed with the attestation gathering process. This process
requires restarting the powHSM, and for that reason, the user will be asked to enter the pin again:
```

After entering the correct pin and pressing `Enter`, the script will proceed with the attestation gathering process,
which concludes the installation process.

Stopping the powHSM...

powHSM Setup complete. Find the installation in /opt/powhsm.
```

Once that step is finished, all the files required by the powHSM will be located in the installation directory:
```
/opt/powhsm/
├── bin
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── hsmsgx
│   ├── hsmsgx_enclave.signed
│   ├── start
│   └── stop
├── kvstore-nvmem-bcstate.dat
├── kvstore-nvmem-bcstate_updating.dat
├── kvstore-password.dat
├── kvstore-retries.dat
└── kvstore-seed.dat
```

### powHSM service setup

Once installation is complete, the script will proceed with the setup of the powHSM service. The powHSM application
is installed as a `systemd` service. The last piece of information required by the script is the name of the docker
network to which the container running the powHSM will be connected. The default value `net_sgx` is suitable for most
cases, but the user is free to choose a different name. Just pressing `Enter` will use the default value:
```
Creating hsm user and group...
Enter the name of the docker network to be created: [net_sgx]
>
```

The user will be required to confirm the creation of the docker network:
```
The docker network will be named 'net_sgx'. Proceed? [Y/n]
> Y
```

After confirming the creation of the docker network, the script will proceed with the setup of the powHSM service. All
the following steps are automated and require no user intervention:
```
Creating net_sgx network...
Setting permisions...
Creating service...
Enabling service...
Starting service...
Service started.
To check the status of the service, run 'systemctl status hsmsgx.service'.
HSM SGX setup done.
```

### Verifying the service status

Once the service is properly set up, the user can verify its status by running:
```
systemctl status hsmsgx.service
```

The output should be similar to:
```

```

### Accessing the logs

At any time, the logs of the powHSM service can be accessed by running:
```
journalctl -u hsmsgx.service
```

## What's next

Once the powHSM service is installed and onboarded, it is ready to be used with the powHSM middleware.
